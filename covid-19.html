    <p>A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat.
    They’re called coronaviruses because under a microscope, they look like a crown.<br><br>
    <strong>What Is COVID-19?</strong><br>
    Coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, is a disease that can cause what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. 
    It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).
    The COVID-19 outbreak quickly spread around the world. It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, 
    mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections range from mild to serious.

    COVID-19 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like Middle East 
    respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other coronaviruses cause most of the 
    colds that affect us during the year but aren’t a serious threat for otherwise healthy people.</p>

    <p>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover 
    without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular
     disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

    <h1>Symptoms</h1>
    <p>Reported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus disease
     2019 (COVID-19) cases.</p>
    <p>These symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure (based on the incubation period of MERS-CoV viruses).

    <ol>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Cough</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
    </ol>

</div>
<div class="new">
    <br><p>The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, septic shock, and death. If you notice these severe symptoms
     in yourself or a loved one, get medical attention right away:
<ul class="para">

    <li>Trouble breathing or shortness of breath</li>
    <li>Ongoing chest pain or pressure</li>
    <li>New confusion</li>
    <li>Can’t wake up</li>
    <li>Bluish lips or face</li>
</ul></p>
<p>

If you’re exposed and infected, symptoms can show up in as few as 2 days or as many as 14. It varies from person to person
<br>
The most common symptoms and the percentage of people who have them include:

<ul class="uff">

    <li>Fever: 88%</li>
    <li>Dry cough: 68%</li>
    <li>Fatigue: 38%</li>
    <li>Coughing up sputum, or thick phlegm, from the lungs: 33%</li>
    <li>Shortness of breath: 19%</li>
    <li>Bone or joint pain: 15%</li>
    <li>Sore throat: 14%</li>
    <li>Headache: 14%</li>
    <li>Chills: 11%</li>
    <li>Nausea or vomiting: 5%</li>
    <li>Stuffy nose: 5%</li>
    <li>Diarrhea: 4%</li>
    <li>Coughing up blood: 1%</li>
    <li>Swollen eyes: 1%</li>

<h1>What Is the Treatment for COVID-19?</h1>
<p>There’s no specific treatment for COVID-19. People who get a mild case need care to ease their symptoms, like rest,
 fluids, and fever control. You can take over-the-counter medicine for a sore throat, body aches, and fever. 
 But don't give aspirin to children or teens younger than 19. You might have heard that you shouldn't take ibuprofen to
  treat COVID-19 symptoms -- the World Health Organization made that statement in March 2020. But they reversed it soon
   after and said there's no proof that taking it causes any harm.</p>
<br>
<p>Antibiotics won’t help because they treat bacteria, not viruses. If you hear about people with COVID-19 getting 
antibiotics, it’s for an infection that came along with the disease.
<br><br>
Those with severe symptoms need to be cared for in the hospital.
<br><br>
Numerous clinical trials are under way to explore treatments used for other conditions that could fight COVID-19 and to
 develop new ones. Several studies are focused on an antiviral medication called remdesivir, which was first created to
  fight Ebola. A study in China showed that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, which are used to treat malaria and
   autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, helped people with COVID-19 pneumonia.<br>
   There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

<h1> Time to take the Precautions!</h1><br><br>
<ul>
    <img src="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/images/sneezingwoman.png" class="precaution" />
    <li><strong>The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.</strong>
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</li>
</ul>
<br><br><br><br><br>
    <h2>Take steps to protect yourself</h2>
<ul>
    <img src="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/images/protect-wash-hands.png" class="precaution" />
    <li><strong>Clean your hands often</strong>
    Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, 
    or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
    <li>If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. 
    Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>
    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
</ul>
<br><br><br><br>
    <h2>Avoid close contact</h2>
    <img src="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/images/protect-quarantine.png" class="precaution" />
<ul>
    <li><strong>Avoid close contact with people who are sick</strong>
    Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in your community.
     This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.</li>
    <li>Take steps to protect others</li>
</ul>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2>Stay home if you’re sick</h2>
<img src="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/images/COVIDweb_02_bed.png" class="precaution" />
<ul>
    <li><strong>Stay home if you are sick,</strong> except to get medical care.</li>
</ul>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2>Cover coughs and sneezes</h2>
<img src="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/images/COVIDweb_06_coverCough.png" class="precaution" />
<ul>
    <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.</li>
    <li>Throw used tissues in the trash.</li>
    <li>Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, 
    clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
</ul>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<h2>Wear a facemask if you are sick</h2>
<img src="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/images/COVIDweb_05_mask.png" class="precaution" />
<ul>
    <li><strong>If you are sick:</strong> You should wear a facemask when you are around other people
     (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. 
     If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), 
     then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a
      facemask if they enter your room. Learn what to do if you are sick.
    
    <li><strong>If you are NOT sick:</strong> You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who
     is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for
      caregivers.</li>
</ul>
<br><br><br>
<h2>Clean and disinfect</h2>
<img src="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/images/COVIDweb_09_clean.png" class="precaution" />
<ul>
    <li>Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, 
    countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.</li>
    <li>If surfaces are dirty, clean them: Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.</li>
